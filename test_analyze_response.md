a# Test analyze_shape_properties Response

## Manual Test Case
Go to Manual Tool Testing tab and try:

**Tool Name:** `analyze_shape_properties`
**Parameters:**
```json
{
  "property": "rounded_corners"
}
```

## Expected Response Format
The response should look something like:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Found 4 shape layers with rounded_corners property",
  "data": {
    "foundCount": 4,
    "property": "rounded_corners",
    "layersWithProperty": [
      {
        "name": "Square1",
        "index": 1,
        "layerIndex": 5,
        "details": {...}
      },
      {
        "name": "Square2", 
        "index": 2,
        "layerIndex": 7,
        "details": {...}
      },
      // ... more layers
    ],
    "layerNames": ["Square1", "Square2", "Square3", "Square4"],
    "layerIndices": [5, 7, 8, 9]  // ← THESE are the actual layer positions
  }
}
```

## Key Points to Check
1. **Are layerIndices present** in the response?
2. **Are they the correct layer positions** (not sequential 1,2,3,4)?
3. **Do they match the layers that actually have rounded corners**?

## Debugging the AI Issue
The AI used `[1,2,3,4]` but the actual layers with rounded corners might be at positions `[5,7,8,9]` or similar.

This means the AI:
1. ❌ **Ignored the response data** 
2. ❌ **Made assumptions** about layer indices
3. ❌ **Deleted the wrong layers** (the first 4 layers instead of the layers with rounded corners)

## Solution Required
The AI needs to:
1. ✅ **Read the analyze_shape_properties response**
2. ✅ **Extract data.layerIndices array** 
3. ✅ **Use those exact indices** in delete_layers_by_index
4. ✅ **Not assume sequential numbering**
