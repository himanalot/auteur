# 🚀 FINAL BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

## ✅ All Development Complete - Execute These Commands

All code changes have been implemented. The extension now needs the final build step to activate all features.

### 🎯 Quick Build (Run This):

```bash
cd "/Users/ishanramrakhiani/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/Maximise AE Tools"
npm run build
```

### 🔍 Verify Build Success:

After the build completes, verify these files have new timestamps:
- `build/static/js/main.*.js` 
- `build/static/css/main.*.css`
- `js/main.*.js` (auto-copied during build)
- `css/main.*.css` (auto-copied during build)

### 🧪 Test the New Features:

1. **Start the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node autonomous-fresh.js
   ```

2. **Test in After Effects**:
   - Open After Effects
   - Go to `Window > Extensions > Maximise AE Tools`
   - Click "Fresh Autonomous Agent" tab
   - Type: "make a new comp"

3. **Verify Fixed Behavior**:
   - ✅ Agent should generate script in a code block (not call save_script_file tool)
   - ✅ You should see `🚀 Execute Script`, `💾 Download .jsx`, `📋 Copy Script` buttons
   - ✅ When script execution fails, `↩️ Undo & Fix` button should appear
   - ✅ Undo & Fix should send conversation context to AI for intelligent error correction

### 🎉 What Will Be Activated:

#### Fixed Autonomous Agent:
- **Before**: Agent called `save_script_file` tool in endless loops
- **After**: Agent generates clean ExtendScript in markdown code blocks

#### New Undo & Fix Workflow:
1. User executes script → Error occurs
2. `↩️ Undo & Fix` button appears
3. Click button → Performs undo (Cmd+Z) in After Effects
4. Sends full conversation + failed script + error to AI
5. AI analyzes and provides corrected script in new code block
6. Repeat process until script works perfectly

### 🔧 Troubleshooting:

If build fails:
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

If features don't appear:
- Verify `main.*.js` file in `/js/` directory has recent timestamp
- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
- Restart After Effects and reload extension

### 📋 Final Checklist:

- [ ] Run `npm run build` successfully
- [ ] Verify new build files exist with recent timestamps  
- [ ] Test autonomous agent generates scripts (not tool calls)
- [ ] Test script execution and error handling
- [ ] Test `↩️ Undo & Fix` button functionality
- [ ] Verify AI receives conversation context for fixes

## 🎯 Status: Ready for Build Execution

**All development work is complete. Just run `npm run build` to activate everything!**
